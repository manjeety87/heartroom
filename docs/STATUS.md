# Status

_Update this file at the end of every working session (any agent, any device)._

**Last updated:** 2026-11-11
**Phase:** Phase 0 done → next is Phase 1 (Bingo rules + vs Computer).

## Done

- [x] Concept + rules agreed (Bingo 1–25 incl. custom grids, Word Guess, rooms, voice, spectators,
      accounts, leaderboard, admin). See `docs/DECISIONS.md`.
- [x] Goldfish review of the concept (4 lenses), games research and the design system.
- [x] Full design doc drafted: `docs/design/heartroom-design.md`.
- [x] Repo created with agent docs (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md), `main` + `dev` branches (main protected).
- [x] Engineering standards written: `docs/engineering/backend.md`, `frontend.md`, `motion.md`.
- [x] **Phase 0** (2026-11-11): pnpm workspace, strict TS, ESLint (purity + import boundaries),
      Prettier, Vitest; `packages/engine` (contract, xoshiro128** Rng, step/replay, `assertNoLeak`,
      `hidden-number` fixture game in `@heartroom/engine/testing`); `packages/protocol` (zod messages,
      `ERROR_CODES`, `CLOSE_CODES`); `packages/ui/src/tokens.css`; `.env.example`.
      77 tests, engine coverage 100% lines / 99% branches.

## Next

1. **Phase 1:** `packages/games/bingo` — rules (#9, N×N grids, linesToWin, shared win), view +
   `perturbHidden` (#10, must pass `assertNoLeak`), bot (#11), tests (#12), UI (#13) and the
   `apps/web` scaffold with the vs Computer page (#14). Design doc › Detailed Implementation Plan › Phase 1.
2. Still open: design doc Open Questions Q1 (pricing), Q2 (Colyseus spike, before Phase 2), Q3 (name check).

## Phases

| Phase | Scope | State |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Workspace, engine, protocol, UI tokens | done 2026-11-11 |
| 1 | Bingo rules + vs Computer (offline) | not started |
| 2 | Rooms (Colyseus) + online Bingo + crash recovery | not started |
| 3 | Voice (LiveKit) + host powers | not started |
| 4 | Google login + history | not started |
| 5 | Word Guess | not started |
| 6 | Leaderboard | not started |
| 7 | Admin dashboard | not started |

## Notes for the next session

- The repo is public, so never commit secrets or personal data.
- Tooling pins (see DECISIONS 2026-11-11): TypeScript 6.0 and ESLint 9 on purpose; don't bump to
  TS 7 / ESLint 10 until typescript-eslint supports TS 7 and the owner is on Node ≥22.13.
- A game proves it hides data with `assertNoLeak(module, { scenarios })` from `@heartroom/engine/testing`;
  `hiddenNumber` there is the smallest complete example of a `GameModule`.
- `tokens.css` was compiled with Tailwind 4.3.5 outside the repo; it is first used for real in Phase 1.
